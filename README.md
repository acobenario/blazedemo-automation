# BlazeDemo QA Automation Project  

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my QA Automation project. Iâ€™m a QA Automation Engineer with 3 years of experience, and this is my personal project where I build, test, and learn more about QA automation. I created this project to sharpen my skills, explore new tools, and showcase my work.  

## What This Project Does  

- **Automates Web Testing**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to run automated test cases for a sample web application.  
- **Manual Testing Docs**: Includes test plans and test cases to show how I approach manual testing.  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up Jenkins for automated test execution (still learning this!).  
- **Reports & Logs**: Generates test results and logs to track whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not.  

## Tools & Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Build Tool**: Maven  
- **Test Framework**: TestNG (might try JUnit later)  
- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver  
- **CI Tool**: Jenkins (still setting this up)  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code

## Why I Built This  

Iâ€™m passionate about QA and automation and wanted to create a project that reflects what Iâ€™ve learned so far. Itâ€™s still a work in progress, and Iâ€™m open to suggestions and feedback!
