# BlazeDemo QA Automation Project  

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my QA Automation project. Iâ€™m a QA Automation Engineer with 3 years of experience using tools such as Python, Robot Framework and Selenium. I created this project to sharpen and demonstrate my skills in QA by integrating manual and automated testing approaches for the BlazeDemo web application.

## What This Project Does  

- **Automates Web Testing**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to run automated test cases for a travel agency demo web application called BlazeDemo.  
- **Manual Testing Docs**: Includes test plans and test cases to show how I approach manual testing.  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up Jenkins for automated test execution (still learning this!).  
- **Reports & Logs**: Generates test results and logs to track whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not.  

## Tools & Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Build Tool**: Maven  
- **Test Framework**: TestNG (might try JUnit later)  
- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Test Management & Bug Tracking Tool**: Jira
- **CI Tool**: Jenkins (still setting this up)  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code

## Project Scope

### **In Scope**
- **Automated Web Testing**: Developing automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver for BlazeDemo.
- **Manual Testing Docs**: Creating test plans and test cases for manual testing, including exploratory and cross-browser tests.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Setting up Jenkins to automate test executions and trigger notifications (still learning and configuring this).
- **Reports & Logs**: Generating test execution reports and logs to monitor test results and system behavior.
- **Test Case Management**: Using JIRA to manage and track the status of test cases, including creating, updating, and linking test cases to user stories or requirements.
- **Bug Tracking**: Using JIRA to log bugs or issues identified during testing and track their resolution.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Automating tests to run across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure compatibility.
- **Test Framework Integration**: Using TestNG for organizing tests and reporting results.

### **Out of Scope**
- **API Testing**: Not implementing API automation tests at this stage (for simplicity, focusing on UI tests only).
- **Performance Testing**: Not including performance or load testing in this iteration.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: No integration with additional tools like Slack for now (unless required).
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Excluding security, usability, or localization testing for now.
- **Automating Non-Core Functionalities**: Focusing on core functionalities of BlazeDemo; features like user accounts or complex workflows will not be prioritized.

## Project Structure  

```
blazedemo-automation
â”‚â”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/java/com/blazedemo/automation   # Automated test scripts  
â”‚â”€â”€ test-data       # External test data files  
â”‚â”€â”€ reports         # Test results and logs  
â”‚â”€â”€ pom.xml         # Maven project file  
```

## Why I Built This  
Iâ€™m passionate about QA and automation and wanted to create a project that reflects what Iâ€™ve learned so far. This project allows me to practice real-world skills and gain hands-on experience with testing tools and frameworks.
